A simple widget app that provides some shortcuts of common letter cases:

- Uppercase
- Lowercase
- Capitalize
- Title
- Capitalize after every period except "..."

Future improvements:

    - Add a tooltip for clarifying a button's letter case function.
    - Detect more accuractely when user selects or not a text.
    - Refactor code for better comprhension and usage of built-in components.

**For developers:**

1. Third-Party libraries used:
    - pyperclip
    - pyautogui

2. GUI library:
    - Tkinter
